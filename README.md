The goal of badgeyay is to provide a simple badge generator with the following features:
* a simple web UI to add data and generate printable badges in a zip
* Fields should include:
   * choose size of badges
   * choose background of badges and upload logo and background image
   * upload CSV or copy/paste text for badges including name, type of attendee, nick/handle, organization/project
   
   
To get a better idea about the working of badgeyay ,you can check out the following:
[![Alt Watch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8705386/30831526-438f8c4c-a237-11e7-83fc-c12046f12e18.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh8j_01LIoQ)

This first step is to provide a simple script to generate the badges for the FOSSASIA conference. The next step is to provide a web UI.

If you like to join developing,

- you can [chat on gitter][gitter], mentioning the maintainers.
- you can find/create [issues](https://github.com/fossasia/badgeyay/issues) and solve them.
  - When you solve an issue, you do not own it. Share your progress via a Pull-Requst as soon as possible.
  - Discuss with others who work on the issue about the best solution. It is your responsibility, not the maintainer's to choose the best solution.
- If in doubt, let's follow [CCCC][cccc].

Specification
-------------

### Technologies Used

Badgeyay uses a number of open source projects:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Microframework powered by python
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - Responsive frontend framework
* [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) - Script used for merging badges of different types
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Webapp deployed here
* [Travis](travis-ci.org) - Continuous Integration of the project
* [Github Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) - Releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to the users

### Input

- The input is a set of csv files in the same folder, UTF-8.
- The csv file is named after the badge type to take. 
  Example: `vip.png.csv` uses the picture `vip.png`.
- The CSV has up to 4 columns for the name and the twitter handle.
  They will be filled if this number is filled:
  - `__X_`
  - `__XX`
  - `_XXX`
  - `XXXX`

### Output

The output file is svg / pdf / multipage pdf of size A3.
Each badge has the size A6.
The outputs are in a folder derived form the input csv.
The outputs can be either of the two types, viz ZIPs or PDFs, or both. User has the choice to choose from either of
the two or from both of them.

### Customization

You can change the font style, font size, color etc from the `.svg` file in the folder badges.
Inkscape is generally used for editing of such files.

### Usage

You need Ubuntu.

You can run the `merge_badges.py` file.
It generates badges for every csv file and combines them to one.
There is a travis build which build the badges automatically.
When a PR is merged into the master branch, the current badges can be downloaded.

### Running locally 
1. [Fork the main repo](https://github.com/fossasia/badgeyay/fork).
2. Clone your local repo. ```git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/badgeyay.git```
3. Create a virtual environment. ```virtualenv -p python3 venv```
4. Activate the virtual environment. ```source activate venv```
5. Install the requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
6. Go to badgeyay/app directory. ```cd badgeyay/app```
