[official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

* Run `docker` and in terminal to see if they are properly installed.

* Clone the project and cd into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fossasia/badgeyay.git && cd badgeyay
```

* In the terminal window, run `sudo docker build -t badgeyay:latest .` to build badgeyay's docker image. This process can take some time.

* After successful build is done, run `sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 badgeyay` to start the server.
